## Relayer

The relayer is the component of the bridge that monitors both the Ethereum and
Concordium chains and acts on events on both of them by submitting transactions
on the other chain.

The relayer collects events and auxiliary data in a PostgreSQL database. The
high-level design of the relayer is as follows.

The relayer consists of a number of tasks that work concurrently.
- A task for looking at events on the Ethereum chain, using the provided API
  URL, e.g., Infura.
- A task for looking at events on Concordium, using a connection to the node
  that is provided.
- A task for sending transactions to the Concordium chain.
- A task for sending transactions to the Etheruem chain (this is called the
  MerkleClient in the code).
- A database task that has exclusive access to the database. It communicates
  with other tasks via MPSC channels. This is used to ensure atomicity of state
  updates, and to make it simpler to do reconnects, since they have to be done
  in a single place only. All processing is done per block and checkpoints are
  stored in the database when blocks are processed.

The overall flow is as follows
- when relevant events are observed on the chain they are written to the
  database.
- if any actions are needed as a result of these events these actions are
  written to the database in the same database transaction as the events
  themselves.
- after the database transaction is committed the relevant transactions are sent
  to either Concordium or Ethereum chains.
- when transactions are sent to Concordium we don't do anything afterwards and
  we rely on the monitoring task to observe when the transaction is finalized
  and its effects.
- when a transaction is send to Ethereum we follow it since we need to update
  the database when it is finalized with auxiliary data needed by the API server
  to produce Merkle proofs.

There is retry logic for events that are deemed transient, and the service will
try for some time to re-establish the connections to Ethereum APIs, Concordium
node, and the database. In case any of the tasks terminate then all are killed
and the service will stop. A task ending prematurely indicates a bug, or failure
to reconnect for some time.

## Configuration options

The service can be configured using either command-line options or environment
variables.

The following configuration options are available

### General configuration

## Logging levels.

The service logs events of interest on `error`, `warn`, `info`, and `debug` levels.

### Error

Only critical errors are logged on this level and most of them lead to service
shutdown. There are some errors logged on this level which should be manually
investigated since they are most likely due to misconfiguration.

### Warn

This level is used to log situations where the service has experienced
intermittent failure, such as loss of connectivity to, e.g., the database. The
service should recover from those situations, but an abnormal number of warnings
should be investigated to identify the root cause.

### Info, Debug.

These are for information purposes only and do not have to be monitored closely.

## Building

The project is a pure Rust project, and can be build by running

```shell
cargo build --release
```

The minimum supported Rust version is 1.67. There are issues with older version,
some with dependencies, and a compiler bug in 1.65 which causes compilation failure.

This produces a single binary `target/release/ccdeth_relayer`.

**Make sure that you have checked and initialized submodules before the build**
e.g., using
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Docker image

A docker image containing the relayer and API server can be built using the
provided [`Dockerfile`](./scripts/build.Dockerfile) as follows **from the root
of the repository**.

```
docker build \
    --build-arg build_image=rust:1.67-buster\
    --build-arg base_image=debian:buster\
    -f relayer/scripts/build.Dockerfile\
    -t ccdeth_relayer:latest .
```

## Metrics

The relayer service exposes a Prometheus exporter if configured with
`ETHCCD_RELAYER_PROMETHEUS_SERVER` or `--prometheus-server` flag. The value
should be `IP:PORT` to listen on. The metrics can be collected on
`IP:PORT/metrics` endpoint. These can be used for monitoring the service for any
irregularity.

The following metrics are exposed
- `concordium_account_balance` - Balance, in microCCD, of the sender account for
  Concordium. This should be monitored so that it does not become too low. If
  this value goes below `--ccd-min-balance` the service will shut down.
- `concordium_height` - Largest processed height for Concordium. This indicates
  progress. If this lingers then likely the service has trouble querying new
  blocks from the Concordium node, or the Concordium node is behind.
- `errors_total` - Number of errors emitted since start of the service. Errors
  are only emitted on irregularities and in normal operation there should not be
  any errors. The logs should be consulted if there are errors.
- `warnings_total` - Number of warnings emitted since start of the service.
  Warnings are non-critical in the sense that the service is expected to recover
  from them. However a large spike in warnings indicates a problem and should be
  investigated.
- `ethereum_account_balance` - Balance, in microEther, of the sender account for
  Ethereum. If this goes below `--eth-min-balance` then the service will stop.
- `ethereum_height` - Largest processed height for Ethereum. This indicates
  progress. If this lingers then likely the service has trouble querying new
  blocks from Etheruem API.
- `merkle_tree_size` - Current size of the Merkle tree for withdrawal approvals.
- `num_completed_deposits` - Number deposits completed on Concordium since start.
- `num_completed_withdrawals` - Number of withdrawals completed since start.
- `num_deposits` -  Number deposits detected since start. This should be close
  to number of completed deposits, but at any point in time there can be a
  slight discrepancy. A large discrepancy indicates and issue.
- `num_withdrawals` - Number of started withdrawals detected since start.
  This will differ from `num_completed_withdrawals` since withdrawals are
  batched and only happen every update interval.
- `sent_concordium_transactions` - Number of transactions sent to Concordium since start.
- `sent_ethereum_transactions` Number of transactions sent to Ethereum since start.
- `timestamp_last_merkle_root` Unix timestamp in seconds of the last time a Merkle root was set.


## Generation of clients for Ethereum contracts.

The relayer needs to interact with the root chain manager on Ethereum, and
listen for events emitted by the state sender contract. The `ethers.rs` library
can generate these clients from the ABI of those contracts (specifically
`src/erc20.rs`, `src/root_chain_manager.rs` and `src/state_sender.rs` are
generated). The build script for the relayer can be used to generate these
clients if the build is run using `generate-client` feature, i.e.,

```
cargo build --feature=generate-client
```

This should only be necessary if the ABI of those contracts changes.
